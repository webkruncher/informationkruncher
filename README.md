WebKrunchers' InformationKruncher

Designed to be simple, standard, and easy to use.

This project is a re-do of the WebKrunchers' KrunchServer formerly hosted
on SourceForge.  The InformationKruncher project is designed using the same
exexml, and the same std::iostream based sockets.  This, and all WebKruncher
projects are intended to be completely free, portable, and simple.

The InformationKruncher is pure C++.  There are many features that modern
web servers offer, but will never be part of the basic InformationKruncher
service.  This keeps the project free of any pollution, and give the user
the leverage to add any features desired.

This is designed to be a starting point, not a complete service.  The bare
bones service does not provide any database interactions, or access to 
persisent data of any kind.  All transasctions are stateless, and serve
static data.
